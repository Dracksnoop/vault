Please modify the **current invoice PDF generation** in the Raydify Vault app so that the invoice format matches exactly the style and layout of the **second invoice** (file named INV-20250718-926.pdf), replacing the current first invoice format.

Key changes to implement:

1. **Header Section:**  
   - Display the company name and complete address block as in the second invoice, including:  
     - Company Name on top  
     - Full Address (office number, street, locality)  
     - Phone number and email below the address  
   - Move “Country” label as in the second invoice, aligned properly.

2. **Invoice Number and Dates:**  
   - Align Invoice Number (#), Invoice Date, Terms, and Due Date vertically with clear labeling and spacing as in the second invoice.  
   - Use the same font sizes and weights.

3. **Customer Name Display:**  
   - Place the customer name or recipient name clearly below the dates as in the second invoice.

4. **Invoice Items Table:**  
   - Format the itemized list to have columns: #, Description, Qty, Rate, Unit, Amount.  
   - Align the columns and data exactly as in the second invoice, including decimal formatting and spacing.  
   - Remove any odd characters or formatting issues visible in the first invoice.

5. **Totals Section:**  
   - Use the “Total In Words” label exactly as in the second invoice with the phrase “Indian Rupee [Amount in words] Only.”  
   - Place Sub Total and Total Rs. aligned below, matching the second invoice’s style.

6. **Footer Section:**  
   - Include the footer text as in the second invoice: account number, IFSC code, address.  
   - Include the detailed notes and disclaimers exactly as the second invoice.

7. **Visual and Styling:**  
   - Use consistent fonts, weights, and spacing to replicate the second invoice exactly.  
   - Remove any extra lines, spacing, or elements that differ from the second invoice.  
   - Ensure alignment and margins match the second invoice for a polished, professional look.

8. **Placeholder for Company Logo and Address:**  
   - Leave space for logo and address to be dynamically inserted from the Profile section in the future.

9. **Do not change any other app functionality, database structure, or routes.**

Deliver the updated PDF generation code/templates that produce invoices visually indistinguishable from the second invoice.

Thank you!
